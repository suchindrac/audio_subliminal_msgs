# audio_subliminal_msgs

Summary:

This is an attempt to display text with varying transparency based on the frequencies in a song

Details:

The script sub_msgs.py as of now reads a file named "output.wav" in the same folder, and displays
 text that is input in the Qt app's input window (top one as of now), with varying transparency
 based on the frequency of the section of the audio

This needs to be modified further

Additional files:

gen_wave.py generates a wave of specified frequency

join.py merges two waves
